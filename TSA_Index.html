		<div class = 'row'>
			<p class = 'text-center'>The Battlefield High School chapter is currently proceeding through its fourth year. With Battlefield’s STEM focus, TSA seemed like the perfect organization to introduce to such a technology-focused environment. Over the years, our members have learned and grown, with some of our senior-most members participating multiple years in our chapter. Together, we have gleaned many insights into our technical world, and made many strides in developing our technical prowess. We’ve taken our successes and our failures from our previous years, and used those to return this year, steadfast in our determination to prove our Chapter.

    	<p>Robotics has always been a major draw for individuals looking to enjoy the world of IT. Our TSA robotics team is, as of writing this webpage, hard at work preparing their robot. We asked our own William Reyes about Robotics, and he had this to say: “VEX robotics is an intense competition involving skill, character, and heart. Vex robotics consists of designing, building, and driving a robot while competing against other schools.” We’re looking forward to their hard work and successes at this year’s Virginia TSA Technosphere.</p>

    	<p>This year, our Music Production team designed their most ambitious song yet. Not only would it feature a myriad of instruments, but they would develop lyrics for their opus. As one of the group members, Jacob Berg, puts: “Music production is by far one of the best events that I have participated in. It has been two years since I began working for this event and it has gotten better each year. We started to cooperate more, we expanded much further than we ever thought was possible, and we got to make some killer tunes while we were at it. We make them totally radical beats that one would jive and thrive to on the midnight chive. Overall, I couldn't have worked on a better project with any better people. In the beginning we were just  Fools in the State of Arizona, but by the end, we had become more unified than we ever had been.”</p>

    	<p>Biotechnology is a fascinating and ever-growing field - yet has remained mostly untouched by our chapter. This year, however, one ambitious group of our members decided to embark on this quest, forming our first ever Biotechnology team. We strive to encourage ambition at Battlefield's chapter, and we are ecstatic that our members are taking this sentiment in stride. While Nathan and Joshua have little experience in the field of Biology, Ratish is currently enrolled in our school's AP Biology course. It is our hope that all three members become emersed in this ever-growing field and that each learns more and more about the applications of technology with biology.

    	<p>Video Production is a popular staple within our chapter, with some of our most successful events stemming from the hard work of our video producers. This year, while the video did not win the regional competition, we still placed highly within the rankings. As one of the video production members, Matthew Byun, states, “Digital Video Production required the collaborative skills of each team member in order to make a mockumentary. These skills included editing, filming, acting and voice acting, as well as attention to detail and leadership. The time spent on the project was enjoyable and brought our team members closer together, and we were able to learn valuable life lessons such as perseverance and selflessness. Although we were unable to come away with a trophy, we were able to gain experience and life lessons through this mockumentary, all while having fun.”</p>
